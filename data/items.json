The end result, of course, is the countless tortured souls formed from the screams and pains of the elements. One such creation is the Acid. Many examples include HCl, H2SO4, etc. Yet they all serve the same function. By channeling the cosmic energy of the long lost elements, they can break down and dissolve most mortal-bound materials, turning them back into the ancient elements that made up the world. Along with alkalis, they form the yin and yang of the universe. Perhaps one day, we can unlock the secrets of acids and alkalis."

Cases of men collapsing from sheer sleepiness have always been the topic of concern, and what could men do to face the worries of sleep?
